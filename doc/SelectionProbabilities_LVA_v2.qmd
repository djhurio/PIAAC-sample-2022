# Three-stage stratified probability proportionate to size (PPS) designs

## PSU selection

$d =$ total number of dwellings to be sampled (main sample and reserve sample together);

$D =$ total number of dwellings in the sampling frame;

$\tilde{d} =$ planned number of dwellings to be sampled in PSU (main sample and reserve sample together);

$D_{hi} = MOS_{hi} =$ number of dwellings in the sampling frame of PSU $i$ of stratum $h$, this is also measure of size for PSU;

$m_h =$ number of PSUs to be sampled in stratum $h$;

Let $r = d / D$ to be the owerall sampling fraction for dwellings.

$$
P_{hi} = \left\lbrace
  \begin{matrix}
    \frac{m_h \times D_{hi}}{\sum_{j \in h} D_{hj}} &
      \text{if} &
      D_{hi} < \frac{\tilde{d}}{r} \\
    1 & \text{if} &
      D_{hi} > \frac{\tilde{d}}{r}
  \end{matrix}
\right.
$$


## DU selection conditional

$d_{hi} =$ number of dwellings to be sampled in PSU $i$ of stratum $h$;

$$
P_{k \mid hi} = \frac{d_{hi}}{D_{hi}}.
$$

The DU sample size in a PSU is

$$
d_{hi} = \left\lbrace
  \begin{matrix}
    \tilde{d} &
      \text{if} &
      D_{hi} < \frac{\tilde{d}}{r} \\
    \left[ D_{hi} \times r \right]_3 \geqslant \tilde{d} &
      \text{if} &
      D_{hi} > \frac{\tilde{d}}{r}
  \end{matrix}
\right.
$$

Please note $d_{hi}$ is rounded to the closest multiple of 3 (because reserve sample is 50 % of the main sample) while preserving the total sample size, namely, $\sum d_{hi} = d$.

## DU selection overall

$$
P_{hik} = \left\lbrace
  \begin{matrix}
    \frac{m_h \times D_{hi}}{\sum_{j \in h} D_{hj}} \times \frac{d_{hi}}{D_{hi}} =
      \frac{m_h \times \tilde{d}}{\sum_{j \in h} D_{hj}} \approx r &
      \text{if} &
      D_{hi} < \frac{\tilde{d}}{r} \\
    \frac{d_{hi}}{D_{hi}} \approx r &
      \text{if} &
      D_{hi} > \frac{\tilde{d}}{r}
  \end{matrix}
\right.
$$



## Person selection conditional

$n_{hik} =$ number of persons to be sampled from dwelling $k$ in PSU $i$ of stratum $h$;

$N_{hik} =$ total number of eligible persons in dwelling $k$ in PSU $i$ of stratum $h$.

$$
P_{l \mid hik} = \frac{n_{hik}}{N_{hik}}.
$$

## Person selection overall

The _overall_ probability of selecting person $l$ from dwelling $k$ in PSU $i$ of stratum $h$ is

$$
P_{hikl} = P_{hi} \times P_{k \mid hi}  \times P_{l \mid hik} = \left\lbrace
  \begin{matrix}
    \frac{m_h \times \tilde{d}}{\sum_{j \in h} D_{hj}} \times
      \frac{n_{hik}}{N_{hik}} &
      \text{if} &
      D_{hi} < \frac{\tilde{d}}{r} \\
    \frac{d_{hi}}{D_{hi}} \times \frac{n_{hik}}{N_{hik}} &
      \text{if} &
      D_{hi} > \frac{\tilde{d}}{r}
  \end{matrix}
\right.
$$

or we can write

$$
P_{hikl} \approx r \times \frac{n_{hik}}{N_{hik}}.
$$
